    "In the medical industry, readmission of patients is such a problem that\n",
    "an external organization penalizes hospitals for excessive readmissions\n",
    "(Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS). When it comes to\n",
    "readmission penalties, studies show\n",
    "\n",
    "that many hospitals are overconfident and underprepared. The percentage\n",
    "of hospitals penalized for readmissions has increased each year since\n",
    "CMS began imposing penalties, and according to the CMS reporting, as\n",
    "much as 78 percent of hospitals were fined in fiscal year 2015. However,\n",
    "three-quarters of hospitals feel confident in their ability to reduce\n",
    "readmissions, and only 55 percent of them anticipate receiving a penalty\n",
    "this year. Given the historical trend and the addition of COPD and Hip\n",
    "and Knee replacement to the list of medical conditions measured, the\n",
    "percentage of hospitals penalized will likely be much higher than 55\n",
    "percent. Additionally, although hospitals are applying various reduction\n",

    "## Task A:  Describe a real-world organizational situation or issue in the Data Dictionary you chose, by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A1. Provide one question that is relevant to your chosen data set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient readmissions represent a significant concern in the medical sector, impacting patient welfare and hospital operations alike. The gravity of the issue is underscored by the fact that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have introduced financial penalties for hospitals experiencing elevated readmission rates (WGU, 2023). Despite the potential economic and image costs, numerous hospitals find themselves ill-equipped to effectively address readmissions. This performance assessment aims to explore this critical gap by looking for factors that might influence a patient's probability of readmission, thus enhancing the data analytics process crucial for fostering better health service outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Are there specific variables that can help predict the likelihood of a patient's re-admittance to the emergency room?\n",
    "\n",
    "  To tackle this question, the `'medical_clean.csv'` dataset (WGU, 2023) has beem cleaned for analysis and will be used. This dataset is rich with a variety of variables that could influence a patient's chances of returning to the hospital. After inspecting and understanding the data in this particular context, Exploratory Data analsys is performed to try and see if variable candidates exist for potential relationships with the `ReAdmis` variable in the data. If none are upon initial examination, one will be chhose for comparison based on the analysits understanding of the data and the question being asked, and past history working with medical data in a hospital setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A2. Explain how stakeholders in the organization could benefit from an analysis of the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders likely include hospital administrators, healthcare staff, patients, and possibly investors. Administrators and staff can use this analysis to pinpoint patients at higher risk of readmission, allowing them to implement preventive strategies. This proactive approach not only curtails costs linked to readmissions but also elevates patient care quality. Patients stand to benefit from improved healthcare practices and reduced likelihood of readmissions, enhancing their overall health outcomes. In essence, this analysis could facilitate more efficient hospital operations and foster better patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A3. Identify all of the data in your data set that are relevant to answering your question in part** *A1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Categories**:\n",
    "  *Patient Characteristics*: Age, gender, and various health conditions.\n",
    "  *Hospital Stay Details*: Treatments administered, duration of hospitalization, and the nature of the patient's initial entry. Importantly, the dataset includes a 'ReAdmis' variable, which is a binary indication (Yes, No) of whether the patient was readmitted within a month of discharge.\n",
    "  *Health Issues*: Hypertension, cerebral incidents, excessive weight, joint inflammation, and sugar imbalances.\n",
    "  *Demographics*: Sex, age bracket, occupation, and educational background.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Variables**: \n",
    "  In this assessment, we will explore associations between categorical variables and patient readmissions through Chi-square statistical tests. We'll focus on categorical variables relevant to this analysis, each with a limited set of distinct levels. For example, while zip codes are nominal categorical variables, their effectiveness is constrained by the extensive number of unique levels in a large dataset. Therefore, we will prioritize variables with a smaller and more manageable number of unique levels for a substantive Chi-square analysis. `Gender`, `HighBlood`, `Stroke`, `Complication_risk`, `Overweight`, `Arthritis`, `Diabetes`, `Hyperlipidemia`, `BackPain`, `Anxiety`, `Allergic_rhinitis`, `Reflux_esophagitis`, `Asthma`, `Services`, `Initial_admin`, `Marital`, `VitD_supp`, `Soft_drink`, `Initial_days`, `TotalCharge`, `Additional_charges`, `Item1`, `Item2`, `Item3`, `Item4`, `Item5`, `Item6`, `Item7`, `Item8`, `ReAdmis`.\n",
