    "(Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS). When it comes to\n",
    "readmission penalties, studies show\n",
    "\n",
    "that many hospitals are overconfident and underprepared. The percentage\n",

    "CMS began imposing penalties, and according to the CMS reporting, as\n",
    "much as 78 percent of hospitals were fined in fiscal year 2015. However,\n",
    "three-quarters of hospitals feel confident in their ability to reduce\n",
    "readmissions, and only 55 percent of them anticipate receiving a penalty\n",
    "this year. Given the historical trend and the addition of COPD and Hip\n",
    "and Knee replacement to the list of medical conditions measured, the\n",
    "percentage of hospitals penalized will likely be much higher than 55\n",
    "percent. Additionally, although hospitals are applying various reduction\n",
