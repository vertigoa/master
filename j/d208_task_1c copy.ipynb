    "I'm wrapping up task 1, and my research question is 'what factors influence the total charge a patient receives'. Total charge has a bimodal distribution that I did a log transform on which helped tremendously. Regarding my final reduced model, the RSE is pretty good, both residual normality and homoscedasticity are mostly there. Both have slight variance from expectations around the tails. For fun I decided to re run my code but filtered my data for patients staying less than a month and it improved my RSE, normality and homoscedasticity. Should I change my research question or keep it broad and just explain the limitations of outlier patients?\n",
