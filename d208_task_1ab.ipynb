    "## Describe the purpose of this data analysis by doing the following::\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A1. Research Question:**\n",
    "**\"A1. Research Question:\n",
    "\"What factors contribute to the length of a patient's hospital stay?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question aims to identify key variables within the dataset that influence `Initial_days`; The number of days the patient stayed in the hospital during the initial visit to the hospital. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **A2. Define the goals of the data analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project sets out to explore the relationship between a response and predictor variables by exploring raw medical data and developing a multiple linear regression model. The research question focuses on identifying any potential factors that affect the length of a patient's hospital stay by exploring factors such as demographic details, medical history, financial factors, and services received. Python and associated libraries are used for analysis, and that supported by visual aids for clarity. Data cleaning and wrangling is emphasized to ensure accuracy and reliability.The Python code for analysis, data cleaning, and preparation will be shared. The culmination of this project involves creating, evaluating and reducing a multiple linear regression model, discussing its significance both statistically and practically, highlighting limitations, and suggesting actionable steps for stakeholders and future analysts based on the findings. Length of stay is a critical metric in healthcare, as it can impact resource allocation, patient satisfaction, and overall hospital efficiency. By identifying the factors that contribute to a patient's hospital stay, healthcare providers can optimize their services, improve patient outcomes, and enhance the overall quality of care.\n",

    "# Part II: Method Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Describe multiple linear regression methods by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B1. Summarize four assumptions of a multiple linear regression model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the research on the assumption of multiple linear regression,, I consistently found five key assumptions that are critical to the validity of the model, rather than four, which added a little confusion. As such I will list five assumptions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Linearity** asserts that there is a straight-line relationship between each predictor (independent variable) and the response (dependent variable). In other words, a straight line can best represent the average change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant. This can be assessed through visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Little to no Multicollinearity** the data points in the dataset do not influence each other. Each observation's response is determined by its predictor values, and should be free from the influence of  other independent variables. Multicollinearity is often checked with the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Independence of Observations** assumes that the observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not be influenced by the value of another observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Homoscedasticity** refers to the requirement that the error terms (differences between observed and predicted values) maintain a constance variance across all points. This constant variance ensures that the model's accuracy does not depend on the value of the predictors. Homoscedasticity is often checked with a residuals plots to look for patterns where there should be none, and can be caused by a variety of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **Normality of Errors** states that the residuals (errors) in the model are normally distributed around a mean of zero. This can be checked with a histogram or Q-Q plot of the residuals. If the residuals are not normally distributed, the model may not be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Statology, n.d.)\n",
    "(Pennsylvania State University, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B2. Describe two benefits of using Python for data analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Libraries:** While R was specifically designed with statistics and data analysis in mind, Python was chosen for its suite of libraries that facilitate every phase of the data analysis process. Libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib along with Seaborn for visualizations. Statsmodels and Scikit-learn offers a platforms for applying regression and machine learning algorithms, streamlining the development of predictive models. These libraries help with a range of data analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility** Python's syntax is known for its intuitiveness and readability, and wide ranging application, making it a favorite for many, from data science to web development. This versatility extends beyond data analysis to other applications such as web development, automation, and deep learning. For instance, an analyst can easily switch from analyzing data to deploying a machine-learning model as a web application within the same programming environment. This flexibility is a significant advantage for working across multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B3. Explain why multiple linear regression is an appropriate technique for analyzing the research question summarized in part I:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is suited well for addressing the research question at hand. Is needed because unlike simple linear regression, there can be multiple variables which is the case here. MLR is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory or predictor (independent) variables to predict the outcome​ of a response or target (dependent) variable, in this case `Initial_days`, the length of time a patients initial stay in the hospital was. This analytical technique is adept at not only identifying but also quantifying the strength and nature of the relationships between `Initial_days` and various predictors. It accounts for multiple factors simultaneously, which can provide a more nuanced insights into their combined effects on the length of a hospital stay. This is necessary for creating a predictive model that can inform decision-making processes."

    "## Note to evaluator: \n",
    "-   This project was a remarkable learning experience, shaped significantly by the guidance of Dr. Straw and Dr. Middleton's advice. Dr. Straw indicated that the project would force tough decisions, highlighting the absence of standout models and the essential nature of hard choices. Dr. Middleton emphasized the importance of casting a wide net in selecting variables for the initial model. Following their advice, I embraced the challenge of making difficult decisions and applied a broad approach in my variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   As I reached the project's conclusion, I recognized possible mistakes and oversights along the way. Despite the urge to correct these errors, I opted to keep them, valuing the learning process over the creation of a flawless model as well as the reality of deadlines. This provides a blueprint of my thinking, offering a reminder of overlooked aspects crucial for future projects, particularly in the Multiple Linear Irrigation case study.\n",

    "# Part III: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Summarize the data preparation process for multiple linear regression analysis by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C1. Describe your data cleaning goals and the steps used to clean the data to achieve the goals that align with your research question including your annotated code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning process starts by reading the data into a pandas DataFrame and performing an initial examination to gain a preliminary understanding of its structure and content. This involves checking data types, identifying duplicate rows, and detecting missing values. Outliers are important to detect and be aware of, particularly when creating predictive regression models. In the context of medical data, outliers can often be the very things that are of interest, such as patients with very high cholesterol levels or very low blood pressure. These values are not necessarily errors but rather important indicators of health conditions. Therefore, outliers will be noted but not necessarily treated unless they are obvious data entry errors or if they hinder the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unique values will be scrutinized to understand the diversity of information within the dataset, dropping unnecessary columns that are not relevant to the research question or predictive model, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats. Some demographic and identifier data, which represents static information about patients and cannot be altered by the hospital, will be excluded from the analysis. Missing data will be identified and addressed, ensuring its proper mitigation, and any duplicate records will be eliminated. Renaming of certain variables for a more descriptive understanding. Rounding data to a reasonable number of decimal places can improve readability and reduce computational complexity. Data visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots will be used to understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns in the data distribution.\n"

    "1. **Broad Inclusion**: Start with a wide array of variables to capture potential influences on `Initial_days`, informed by my domain knowledge.\n",
    "2. **Build Initial Model**: Use this extensive dataset to identify significant predictors.\n",

    "*Note: I am a former health care professional who has worked in several hospitals and have had extensive hospital stays as a patient. While I am not an expert on this particular data, I do have some domain knowledge and this domain knowledge informs my decision making here.*\n",
    "- **TotalCharge & Additional Charges**: Possible high correlation and generally a result of `Initial_days` not a cause of. Patients and staff often unaware of these charges until after the fact.\n",
    "- **Latitude & Longitude**: Limited interpretive value and adds to model complexity.\n",
    "- **Identifiers (Customer_id, Interaction, UID)**: High uniqueness; ethical concerns.\n",
    "- **Geographic (City, State, County, Zip, Population)**: Overly detailed, increasing model complexity, not short/medium term actionable.\n",
    "- **TimeZone**: Relevance to hospital stay length is questionable, increases complexity.\n",
    "- **Full_meals_eaten**: Restrictive and targeted diets and meals are so common and depends on patient and services that without context ths variable is not useful.\n",
    "- **Job**: Subjective and variable in interpretation. Better suited for targeted occupational study.\n",
    "- **Services**: All very common in diagnostic phase and itself dependent on too many unknown factors, and not likely to be significant predictors. Could add confusion. \n",

Precision beyond 2 decimal places does not add meaningful information for the analysis.

In healthcare data, for instance, it's unlikely that fractions of a day to eight decimal places would impact decisions or care outcomes.\n",

    "I'm wrapping up task 1, and my research question is 'what factors influence the total charge a patient receives'. Total charge has a bimodal distribution that I did a log transform on which helped tremendously. Regarding my final reduced model, the RSE is pretty good, both residual normality and homoscedasticity are mostly there. Both have slight variance from expectations around the tails. For fun I decided to re run my code but filtered my data for patients staying less than a month and it improved my RSE, normality and homoscedasticity. Should I change my research question or keep it broad and just explain the limitations of outlier patients?\n",
