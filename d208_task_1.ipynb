    "This question aims to identify key variables within the dataset that influence hospital charges, including length of stay, services rendered, patient risk factors, and demographic details. The goal is to understand the primary drivers of hospital expenses. This information can be used to help predict charges for future patients, allowing hospitals to better manage their resources and improve patient care.\n",
